      "text": "Once we\u2019re out of sight of the others, he backs me against the largest boulder and then lowers into a crouch before me. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d I run my fingers through his hair just because I can. The fact that I get to touch this man is absolutely mind-blowing, and I plan on taking every advantage of the privilege while I can. \u201cYour legs are stiff.\u201d He starts at my calves, working the knots loose with his strong hands. \u201cI guess we can\u2019t really leave until the dragons are ready anyway, right?\u201d His touch feels downright decadent. \u201cRight. We have another ten minutes or so.\u201d He flashes a wicked grin at me. Ten minutes. Considering we really have no idea what the rest of the day will bring, I\u2019m more than happy to grab ahold of what time we have. I groan as my muscles melt and my head falls back to rest on the boulder. \u201cThat hurts so wonderfully. Thank you.\u201d He laughs, making his way up to the tense muscles of my thighs. \u201cTrust me, my motives aren\u2019t altruistic, Violence. I\u2019ll take any excuse I can get to put my hands on you.\u201d The scruff on his cheeks scrapes my palms as I slide my hands down the sides of his face to cup the back of his neck. \u201cThe feeling is more than mutual.\u201d His breathing changes when he reaches the top of my thighs, his fingers kneading my muscles into outright submission. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about this morning.\u201d \u201cWhat?\u201d He looks up at me, the sunlight catching the gold specks in his eyes, and arches his scarred brow. \u201cWe were in the middle of something, if you don\u2019t remember.\u201d A slow smile spreads across my face. \u201cOh, I remember.\u201d The top button of his flight jacket is undone, and I grip the fabric and tug him toward me. At what point is this constant craving for him going to be assuaged? I\u2019ve had him multiple times in the past twenty-four hours and could still go another round\u2026or three. \u201cIs it wrong to wish we\u2019d had time to finish?\u201d \u201cNot sure I\u2019ll ever be finished .\u201d He rises, every plane of his body caressing mine on the way up. \u201cI\u2019m way too fucking greedy when it comes to you.\u201d He slants his head over mine and blurs out the rest of the world with a slow, luxurious kiss. His tongue slides between my parted lips to glide against mine like he has absolutely no other plans for the day but to memorize every corner of my mouth. My entire body flares to life, then starts to simmer when he kisses a path down my throat. He palms my waist, pulling my curves flush with his hard angles, and I\u2019m nothing but heat and need. My heart pounds so hard, it sounds like wingbeats in my ears. Gods, I\u2019ll never get enough of this. He groans, one hand sliding to my ass. \u201cTell me what you\u2019re thinking.\u201d I wind my arms around his neck. \u201cI was thinking you are exactly as I predicted the first time you took me in my room.\u201d \u201cOh yeah?\u201d He draws back, curiosity sparking in his eyes. \u201cAnd what exactly was that?\u201d \u201cA very dangerous addiction.\u201d My gaze skims over the silver line of his scar, the thick lashes so many women would kill for, and over the bump in his nose to that perfectly sculpted mouth. I\u2019ve already told him that I love him, so it\u2019s not like I\u2019m keeping secrets over here. Hell, compared to him, I\u2019m an open book. \u201cImpossible to sate.\u201d His eyes darken. \u201cI\u2019m going to keep you,\u201d he promises, just like he did last night. Or was it this morning? \u201cYou\u2019re mine, Violet.\u201d I lift my chin. \u201cOnly if you\u2019re mine.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve been yours for longer than you could ever imagine.\u201d As if the words untether him, he clutches the nape of my neck and kisses me long and hard, stealing every breath, every thought beyond the sweep of his tongue and the rising tide of need that heats her skin. Xaden yanks his mouth away with a gasp, breaking the kiss and cocking his head to the side as if listening for something. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d I ask. He\u2019s gone rigid beneath my arms. \u201cShit.\u201d His eyes widen as he drags his gaze back to mine. \u201cViolet, I\u2019m so sorry\u2014\u201d \u201cIs this seriously how you dragon riders spend your time?\u201d a woman asks from behind Xaden, her voice like velvet dragged over a gravel road.",

      "text": "\u201cFuck it.\u201d One second he\u2019s out of reach and the next his mouth is on mine, hot and insistent. Gods, yes . This is exactly what I need. I\u2019m trapped between the immovable stone of the wall and the hard lines of Xaden\u2019s body, and there\u2019s nowhere else I\u2019d rather be. The thought should sober me, but all I do is lean in for more. He tunnels a hand through my hair, cradling the back of my head, angling me for a deeper kiss, and my lips part eagerly. He takes the invitation, sliding his tongue along mine with expert, teasing strokes that have me clutching at his chest, fisting the material of his shirt to pull him closer as desire dances up and down my spine. He tastes like churam and mint, like everything I\u2019m not supposed to want and yet can\u2019t help needing, and I kiss him back with everything I have, sucking on his lower lip and scraping my teeth over him. \u201cViolence,\u201d he moans, and the sound of the nickname on his lips makes me ravenous. Closer. I need him closer. As though he can hear my thoughts, he kisses me harder, claiming every line and curve of my mouth with a reckless edge that makes my body sing. He\u2019s just as needy as I am, and when he shifts his grip to my ass and picks me up, I wrap my legs around his waist and hold on like my life depends on this kiss never ending. The wall digs into my back, but I don\u2019t care. My hands are finally in his hair and it\u2019s just as soft as I imagined. He kisses me until I feel thoroughly devoured and explored, and then he sucks my tongue into his mouth so I can do the same. This is complete and utter madness, and yet I can\u2019t stop. Can\u2019t get enough. I could live forever in this tiny slice of insanity if it means keeping his mouth on mine, leaving my world narrowed to the heat of his body and the skilled stroke of his tongue. His hips rock into mine, and I gasp at the delicious friction. He breaks the kiss, sliding his mouth across my jaw, my neck, and I know I\u2019ll do anything to keep him here with me. I want to feel his mouth everywhere . We\u2019re a tangle of tongues and teeth, questing lips and hands as the snow falls around us, and the kiss consumes me the same way the power had before, so thoroughly I can feel it in every cell in my body. Need pulses between my thighs, and I jolt at the simple knowledge that there\u2019s nothing he could do that I wouldn\u2019t welcome. I want him. Only him. Here. Now. Anywhere. Whenever. I\u2019ve never been this out of control over a single kiss. Never wanted someone the way I do him. It\u2019s exhilarating and terrifying at the same time because I know that in this moment, he has the power to break me. And I\u2019d let him. I surrender completely, melting into him, my body going pliant against his and losing that mental foothold he calls grounding. A flash of light burns behind my closed eyes, followed by the boom of thunder. Thunder-snow isn\u2019t uncommon around here, but damn does it summarize how this feels, wild and out of control. But then he breaks the kiss with a sharp gasp, his brow furrowing with something akin to panic before he slams his eyes shut. I\u2019m still struggling to draw a full breath when he abruptly steps away from the wall and palms the backs of my thighs, setting me on my feet again. He makes sure I\u2019m steady and then retreats a few feet, like the distance will save his life. \u201cYou have to go.\u201d His words are clipped and at odds with the heat in his eyes, his ragged breaths. \u201cWhy?\u201d The cold is a shock to my system without his body heat. \u201cBecause I can\u2019t.\u201d He rakes both hands through his hair and leaves them on the top of his head. \u201cAnd I refuse to act on desire that isn\u2019t yours. So you have to walk back up those steps. Now.\u201d I shake my head. \u201cBut I want\u2014\u201d Everything. \u201cThis isn\u2019t your want.\u201d He tilts his head up at the sky. \u201cThat\u2019s the fucking problem. And I can\u2019t leave you out here on your own, so have just a little mercy on me and go .\u201d",

      "text": "Daggers, both his and mine, hit the ground as he unstraps the sheaths at my thighs and undoes his own. It\u2019s a glorious cacophony of metal until we\u2019re both naked and he\u2019s kissing me breathless. Then his hands are in my hair, and pins fly until the mass falls down my back, unbound. He pulls back only long enough to rake his ravenous gaze down my body. \u201cSo fucking beautiful.\u201d \u201cI think that might have been a little longer than two\u2014\u201d I start, but he grabs the back of my thighs and lifts, sweeping my feet out from underneath me. My back hits the bed with a slight bounce, and honestly, I should have seen that move coming given that he\u2019s been putting me on my back for the better part of a year now. \u201cStill counting?\u201d he asks, dropping to his knees beside the bed and dragging me across the soft coverlet to the edge. \u201cDo you need me to keep score?\u201d I tease as my ass hits the end of the bed. \u201cFeel free.\u201d He grins, and before I can get another word in, his mouth is between my thighs. I suck in a sharp breath and throw my head back at the sheer pleasure of his tongue, licking and swirling around my clit. \u201cOh gods .\u201d \u201cWhich one are you calling out for?\u201d he asks against my flesh. \u201cBecause it\u2019s just you and me in this room, Vi, and I don\u2019t share.\u201d \u201cYou.\u201d My fingers tangle in his hair. \u201cI\u2019m calling out for you.\u201d \u201cI appreciate the elevation to deity, but my name will do.\u201d He licks me from entrance to clit, finally flicking his tongue over that sensitive bud, and I moan. \u201cFuck, you taste good.\u201d He lifts my thighs up onto his shoulders and settles in like he has nowhere else to be tonight. Then he absolutely devours me with tongue and teeth. Pleasure, hot and insistent, spirals in my stomach and I\u2019m lost in sensation, my hips rising and falling as I chase the high he drives me toward with every expert stab of his tongue. My thighs tremble when he takes up a rhythm against my clit and drives two fingers inside me. They lock when he strokes his fingers in time with his tongue. Mindless, I\u2019m simply mindless. Power rushes through me in a deluge, mingling with the pleasure until they\u2019re one and the same, and when he tips me over the edge of oblivion, it\u2019s his name I scream as that power whips outward with every wave of my climax. Thunder booms, shaking the paneled glass in Xaden\u2019s windows. \u201cThat\u2019s one,\u201d he says, kissing his way up my limp body. \u201cThough I do think we\u2019re going to have to work on the fireworks show or people are always going to know what we\u2019re doing.\u201d \u201cYour mouth is\u2026\u201d I shake my head as his hands slide under me, moving us to the center of his bed. \u201cThere are no words for that.\u201d \u201cDelicious,\u201d he whispers, his lips skimming the plane of my stomach. \u201cYou are absolutely delicious. I never should have waited this long to get my mouth on you.\u201d I gasp when he sucks the peak of my breast into his mouth, his tongue lashing and stroking my nipple as he works the other between thumb and forefinger, setting a whole new fire within me built on the embers of the first. By the time he gets to my neck, I\u2019m a writhing flame beneath him, touching every part of him I can reach, stroking my hands down his arms, his back, his chest. Gods, this man is incredible, every line of him carved for battle and built by sparring and swordplay. Our mouths meet in a deep kiss, and I can taste us both in it as I draw my knees upward, settling his hips right where they\u2019re meant to be\u2014between my thighs. \u201cViolet,\u201d he groans, and I can feel the head of him at my entrance. \u201cI don\u2019t get equal time to play?\u201d I tease, arching my hips so he slides against me and making my own breath catch with the motion. He nips my lower lip. \u201cYou can play all you want later if I can have you right now.\u201d Yeah, that\u2019s a plan I can get with. \u201cYou already have me.\u201d His gaze collides with mine as he hovers above me, bracing his weight to keep from crushing me. \u201cYou have everything I have to give.\u201d That\u2019s enough\u2026for now. I nod, arching my hips again. Eyes locked with mine, he pushes into me with one long roll of his hips, consuming every inch and then taking another until he\u2019s seated to the hilt. The pressure, the stretch, the fit of him is beyond words. \u201cYou feel so damn good.\u201d I roll my hips because I can\u2019t help myself. \u201cI could say the same thing about you.\u201d He smiles, using my own words from earlier against me. Hard, deep, and slow, he sets a rhythm that has me arching for every thrust as we come together again and again and again. He drives us up the bed, and I throw my arms back, bracing against the headboard for leverage as I meet every plunge of his hips. Gods, each is better than the last. When I urge him to move faster, he gives me a wicked grin and takes me at the same mind-blowing, heart-jolting pace. \u201cI want this to last. I need this to last.\u201d \u201cBut I\u2019m\u2026\u201d That fire in my core is coiled tight and so ready to burst free that I can almost taste how sweet it will be. \u201cI know.\u201d He drives forward again, and I whimper at how fucking good it feels. \u201cJust stay with me.\u201d He adjusts the angle so he hits my clit with every thrust and presses my knee forward, taking me even deeper. I\u2019m not going to survive this. I\u2019m going to die right here in this bed. \u201cThen I\u2019m going to die with you,\u201d he promises, kissing me. I\u2019m so far gone, I didn\u2019t even realize I said the words out loud, and then I remember that I don\u2019t have to. \u201cMore. I need more.\u201d Power simmers beneath my skin and my legs lock. \u201cYou\u2019re almost there. Fuck, you feel so damn good around me. I\u2019m never going to get enough of this, enough of you.\u201d \u201cI love you.\u201d The words are so incredibly freeing, even if he doesn\u2019t say them back. His eyes flare and his control snaps as he pounds into me, and that coiled pleasure explodes as my powers whip out again, cracking through the room, shattering like glass as he throws his weight to the side, bringing me with him as he drives toward his own release, groaning into the side of my neck as the last waves of my orgasm leave me shuddering against him. Long minutes pass before our breathing steadies, and a light breeze kisses my thigh that\u2019s thrown over his. \u201cYou\u2019re all right?\u201d he asks, brushing my hair back from my face. \u201cI\u2019m great. You\u2019re great. That was\u2026\u201d \u201cGreat?\u201d he supplies. \u201cExactly.\u201d \u201cI was going to use the word \u2018explosive,\u2019 but I think \u2018great\u2019 covers it.\u201d His fingers tangle in my hair. \u201cI fucking love your hair. If you ever want to bring me to my knees or win an argument, just let it down. I\u2019ll get the point.\u201d I grin as the breeze rustles through the brown-to-silver strands. Wait. There shouldn\u2019t be a breeze. My stomach drops as I push myself up on an elbow to look over Xaden\u2019s shoulder. \u201cOh no, no, no.\u201d My hand covers my mouth as I glimpse the destruction. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure I blew your window out.\u201d \u201cUnless there\u2019s someone else throwing lightning around, then yeah, that was you. See what I mean? Explosive.\u201d He laughs. I gasp. That\u2019s why he threw himself sideways, to shield me from my own wreckage. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d I scan over the damage, but there\u2019s only sand on the bed. \u201cI\u2019m going to have to get that under control.\u201d \u201cI threw up a shield. Don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d He pulls me back in for a kiss. \u201cWhat are we going to do?\u201d Repairing a window is on a whole different level from replacing an armoire. \u201cRight now?\u201d He strokes my hair back from my face again. \u201cThat was two, if we\u2019re still counting, and I say we clean up, get the sand out of the bed, and get you to three, maybe four if you\u2019re still awake.\u201d My jaw drops. \u201cAfter I just shattered your window?\u201d He smiles and shrugs . \u201cI\u2019ve got us covered just in case you decide to take out the dresser next.\u201d I gaze down at his body, and the craving for him ignites again. How could it not when he looks like the gods blessed him and feels like the gods blessed me ? \u201cYeah, let\u2019s go for three.\u201d We\u2019re going for five, my hips in Xaden\u2019s hands while I slowly ride him, when I trail my fingers down the black swirls of the relic on his neck. I\u2019m not sure how either of us is still moving, and yet we can\u2019t seem to stop tonight, can\u2019t get enough. \u201cIt really is beautiful,\u201d I tell him, rising up only to sink back down again, taking him deep within me. His dark eyes flare as his hands flex. \u201cI used to think of it as a curse, but now I realize it\u2019s a gift.\u201d He arches his hips, hitting me at a sublime angle. \u201cA gift?\u201d Gods, he\u2019s robbing me of every thought. Someone pounds on the door. \u201cGo the fuck away!\u201d Xaden snarls, reaching up my back and hooking onto my shoulder to pull me down into his next thrust. I fall forward, muffling my moan in his neck. \u201cI really wish I could.\u201d There\u2019s enough regret in the voice that I believe it. \u201cSomeone better be dead if I get out of this bed, Garrick,\u201d Xaden retorts. \u201cI think there\u2019re a lot of people dead, which is why they\u2019re calling the full quadrant to formation, jackass!\u201d Garrick growls. Both Xaden and I startle, our gazes colliding in shock. I slide off him, and Xaden covers me with his blanket before shoving his legs into his leathers and striding for the door. \u201cWhat the fuck are you talking about?\u201d he asks through a tiny opening in the door. \u201cGrab your flight leathers, and you\u2019d better bring Sorrengail with you, too,\u201d Garrick says. \u201cWe\u2019re under attack.\u201d",

I whimper with pure want at the feel of how hard he is for me. \u201cI always fucking want you.\u201d He groans as I squeeze. Then he lifts his head, seizes my gaze with his, and I recognize the wild need in those gold-flecked depths. It mirrors my own. \u201cYou walk into a room, and I can\u2019t look away. I get anywhere near you, and this is what happens. Instantly hard. Fucking hell, I can barely think when you\u2019re around.\u201d He rocks his hips into my hand, and my grip tightens along with my stomach. \u201cWanting you is not the problem here.\u201d \u201cThen what is?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m trying to do the honorable thing and not take advantage of you after you\u2019ve had a shit day.\u201d His jaw flexes. I smile and kiss the side of his mouth. \u201cIt\u2019s always a shit day around here. And it\u2019s not taking advantage when I\u2019m asking\u201d\u2014my teeth nip at his lips\u2014\u201ccorrection, begging you to make my day better.\u201d \u201cViolet.\u201d He says my name like a warning, as if he\u2019s something I should be wary of. Violet. He only says my name when it\u2019s just the two of us, when all the walls and the pretenses fall away, and gods if I don\u2019t want to hear it again and again, just like that. \u201cI don\u2019t want to think, Xaden. I just want to feel.\u201d I release him. One tug of the ribbon is all it takes to unravel the long, loose braid of my hair, and I run my fingers through the mass. His eyes darken, and I know I\u2019ve won. \u201cFuck me, this hair,\u201d he says, then hovers his mouth over mine. \u201cAnd this mouth . All I ever want to do is kiss you, even when you piss me off.\u201d \u201cSo kiss me.\u201d I arch into him and claim his lips, kissing him like this might be the only time I\u2019ll get the chance. This kind of desperation isn\u2019t natural; it\u2019s a wildfire that\u2019s likely to burn us both to the ground if we let it. The kiss is blatantly, deliciously carnal, and I melt against him, matching every thrust of his tongue with mine. He tastes like mint, and Xaden, and I can\u2019t get enough. He\u2019s the worst kind of addiction, dangerous and impossible to sate. \u201cTell me to stop,\u201d he whispers, his thumb skimming the hypersensitive skin of my inner thigh. \u201cDon\u2019t stop.\u201d I\u2019ll die if he does. \u201cFuck, Violet,\u201d he groans, slipping his hand between my thighs. Never mind. That is how I want him to say my name from now on. Just like that. He glides the fabric of my underwear across my clit, and my back arches at the burst of pleasure that radiates through my body, so sweet I can taste it. He captures my mouth with his again in a hungry assault, his tongue sliding against mine as his fingers stroke me through the fabric, expertly using it for friction. I try to rock my hips against his hand for more, but my feet dangle off the desk, robbing me of leverage. I can only have what he decides to give. \u201cTouch me,\u201d I demand, my fingernails biting into the back of his strong neck, desire pounding through me like a drumbeat. His voice is ragged against my mouth. \u201cIf I get my hands on you, really, honestly get my hands on you, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll be able to stop.\u201d He would. I know it in my soul. That\u2019s why I trust him with my body. My heart? It isn\u2019t playing into this decision. \u201cStop being so fucking honorable and fuck me, Xaden.\u201d His eyes flare, and then he kisses me like I\u2019m the air he\u2019s been missing, like his life depends on it, and I think mine just might. His fingers slide under my underwear and stroke my slickened core, and a moan tumbles from my lips. His touch is electric. \u201cSo damned soft.\u201d He kisses me deeply as his fingers touch and tease, making that sweet coil of pleasure tighten in my core. I dig my nails into his shoulder, my back arching as he makes tighter and tighter circles against my swollen clit. \u201cI bet you taste just as good as you feel.\u201d Pleasure shudders through me, a living, breathing fire beneath my skin. \u201cMore.\u201d It\u2019s all I\u2019m capable of saying, demanding, as my skin flushes and my pulse skyrockets. I\u2019m going to combust, to burst into flames, and all I can do is whimper against his mouth as he slides one finger inside me. My muscles clench around him, and he works in a second. \u201cYou\u2019re so fucking hot.\u201d His voice drops, sounding like it\u2019s been scraped over coals. \u201cIt might damn us both, but I can\u2019t wait to feel you come around my cock.\u201d \u201cOh gods. \u201d That mouth . I throw my hands back against the wall for leverage, knocking something loose as my hips roll. Something shatters on the floor to the left as I ride his thrusting fingers. He curls them against my inner walls and I gasp, my thighs locking around his leather-clad hips. And when he uses his thumb to stroke my clit, the friction and pressure push me to the edge of mindless bliss. I cry out, and he covers the sound with his mouth, kissing with devious strokes of his tongue that match the movement of his fingers within me. Power surges, rippling through my bones, and I grab onto Xaden even harder, surprised at the unexpected rush of crackling energy. \u201cLook at you. You\u2019re fucking beautiful, Violet. Let go for me.\u201d His words curl around my mind, his mouth fused to mine, and the intimacy of it pushes me to the limit of pleasure and then right over it. He swallows my cry as my back bows, the first wave of my orgasm washing over me, releasing that tight coil of tension in a burst of sparks at the edge of my vision, breaking me into a million scattered stars. Lightning strikes outside my window, flashing light through the room again and again as he strokes me with an expertise that kicks the first climax into a second. \u201cXaden,\u201d I moan as the pleasure ebbs and flares again. He grins and slides his fingers from my body, and I\u2019m nothing but ragged breaths and raw hunger as I reach for his shirt. I want it off now . He accommodates my urgency, ripping off the fabric, and then we\u2019re kissing again, all swirling tongues and roaming hands. The feel of his skin under my fingertips is divine, impossibly soft over yards of hard muscle. I trace the lines of his back, memorizing the dips and hollows as sinew ripples with every move he makes. \u201cI need you now ,\u201d I gasp and reach for the buttons of his leathers. \u201cYou know what you\u2019re saying?\u201d he asks as I shove the fabric\u2014and any cloth beneath\u2014past his hips, freeing the thick length of his cock. It\u2019s hot and hard in my hand, and the moan that rips from his lips makes me feel invincible. \u201cI\u2019m asking you to fuck me.\u201d I arch up and kiss him. He groans, dragging my hips to the edge of the desk, then working my underwear down my legs, leaving me bare. My pulse skyrockets. \u201cI take the fertility suppressant.\u201d Of course, we both do. The last thing anyone wants are little quadrant babies running around. But it\u2019s better said than sorry. \u201cSame.\u201d He grips my hips, lifting me for a better angle, and the head of his cock rubs against my clit. I gasp and his eyes lock with mine. The hunger I see etched in every tense line of his body is my undoing. I don\u2019t care if it damns us. I need him. No more holding back. Not anymore. I reach between us, guiding the head of his cock to my entrance, but this position is shit. He\u2019s considerably taller than the desk, and if I wasn\u2019t so desperate for him, I\u2019d laugh, but I am. I arch, but it doesn\u2019t help. Every second we wait feels like it stretches on for a decade. \u201cFucking desk,\u201d he swears. My thoughts exactly. His biceps flex as he lifts me by the backs of my thighs, and I wrap my arms around his neck and my legs around his waist, my dressing gown caught between us as he pivots. Our mouths meet in a ravenous kiss as my back hits the armoire, but I barely blink, too consumed with the stroke of his tongue, the feel of him between my thighs. \u201cShit. Are you all right?\u201d he asks. \u201cI\u2019m fine. You won\u2019t break me.\u201d He pushes inside that first, tight inch of me, and I gasp at the fit, the stretch. \u201cMore.\u201d I\u2019m too busy kissing him to speak. \u201cI need all of you.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re going to be the death of me, Violet.\u201d Whatever\u2019s left of his control slips, and he takes me completely with one hard thrust. I moan into the kiss. Deep . He\u2019s so fucking deep that I feel him everywhere. \u201cTell me you\u2019re all right.\u201d He\u2019s already moving, thank gods. \u201cI\u2019m perfect.\u201d Better than perfect. Power blazes beneath my skin again, buzzing in wordless, frenzied demand. \u201cYou feel so fucking good.\u201d He slams back into me, again and again, as he sets a brutal, steady pace, his mouth sliding down my neck as his hand rises to cup my breast. I can\u2019t even think around the maddening pleasure as my back pounds the armoire door with every thrust, filling the room with the sound of our straining bodies and creaking wood. Every stroke is better than the last. My breaths stutter. \u201cFuck, I\u2019m never going to get enough of you, am I?\u201d he says, his face buried in my neck as I arch into him. \u201cShut up and fuck me, Riorson.\u201d Tomorrow is soon enough for regrets. Reaching up, I grasp the top edge of the armoire with one hand so I can rock back with more force, meeting the drive of his hips, taking him deeper, harder. He drags one of my nightgown\u2019s straps off my shoulder, and the cool night air kisses the hardened peak of my nipple a heartbeat before his hot mouth covers it. The sensations spiral, spinning and coiling, forming a tight knot of pleasure so deep within me, the tension is sublimely unbearable. The armoire door groans, then splinters off the hinges, and Xaden\u2019s shadows whip out, protecting me as the frame snaps and wood crashes around us. My power flares, rising in answer to his, sizzling beneath my skin as I grab ahold of his shoulders, my mouth finding his. There\u2019s no stopping. We can\u2019t stop. \u201cFuck,\u201d he curses as he takes me over and over, never stopping, turning us again so there\u2019s cloth against my back. But it\u2019s not the bed. It\u2019s the curtains shoved to the side of the window. Energy crackles again as our mouths meet, and still he drives on, winding that knot inside me painfully tighter with every movement. And the power\u2026it\u2019s too much. It\u2019s burning me, heating my blood with the need for release. \u201cXaden,\u201d I cry out, simultaneously writhing yet holding on to him like he\u2019s the only thing anchoring me to the earth. \u201cI\u2019ve got you, Violet,\u201d he promises, his breath ragged pants against his lips. \u201cLet it out.\u201d Lightning whips through me, flashing so bright that my eyes slam shut. Heat flares above me as thunder cracks immediately. And I smell smoke. \u201cShit.\u201d Xaden\u2019s power fills the room, eclipsing what light we had, and the curtain falls, but we\u2019re moving before the charred fabric can so much as touch my skin. That knot of pleasure builds to a breaking point as he takes me to the floor, and finally , I have all of his weight as he drives into me. Shadows fall away and the sight of him above me, his dark gaze locked on mine in intense concentration, is the most beautiful sight I\u2019ve ever seen. \u201cSo. Very. Beautiful.\u201d I punctate each word with a kiss. He draws back, his eyes searching mine for a heartbeat or two before he devastates me with another kiss that has me straining for more, rocking my hips against his. This man kisses with his whole body, rolling his hips in time with the thrust of his tongue, bracing just enough of his weight so I can breathe while stroking his chest over my hypersensitive nipples. He keeps me on the same edge he\u2019s riding, and I don\u2019t know how much longer I can take it before I set this entire room on fire. \u201cI need\u2026I need\u2026\u201d My frantic eyes search his. Where are my words? \u201cI know.\u201d He claims my mouth again and reaches between us, using those talented fingers to stroke me into another orgasm, and light flashes again, followed by thunder and darkness as I come apart under him. Pleasure takes me in waves, rolling through me again and again until all I can do is clutch Xaden\u2019s shoulders and ride it out in blissful surrender. \u201cBeautiful,\u201d he whispers. The second I come down, his rhythm breaks, and he presses my knee up toward my chest and takes me even deeper. I rock my hips up to meet his, sweat beading on our skin as I watch him unravel with rapt fascination. I love his loss of control just as much as I fear my own, and when I swirl my hips, he groans, arching his neck as he thrusts once. Twice. On the third, he shouts, then shudders within me, and his power lashes out in streaks of shadows, the force splitting the wooden target on the other side of the window. Pieces fly and Xaden throws out another wave of darkness that lasts just long enough to shield us from the debris. Then the shadows retreat and daggers clatter to the ground behind me. He looks as shocked, and as enthralled, as I feel as we lay there, staring at each other, our chests heaving in the aftermath of what can only be described as complete and utter madness.",
